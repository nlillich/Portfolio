                        Hello there! I am Nate and this is my portfolio. As a senior studying computer science at 
                        Kansas State University, I have spent the past few years creating a lot of exciting programs. 
                        Within my portfolio is some of my favorite programs I have developed that help to showcase my 
                        skills and experiences. My goal is to continue my passion of developing programs after graduation.

                    Sudoku solver that utilizes the functionality of simulated annealing to search for local solutions 
                    until a certain temperature is reached or a final solution is found. The program runs fully in the console
                    and is written using python. A reheating case is implemented for if the algorithm gets trapped at 
                    a local maximum before the final solution is found.

                    Python program that utilizes five different search algorithms to solve various mazes. Program runs 
                    fully within the terminal and uses hardcoded text files to populate the mazes. The five search algorithms 
                    implemented are random search, depth-first search, breadth-first search, greedy search, and A* search.

                    The purpose of this progress report was to update an audience of both professionals and executives as to how 
                    the project was currently going and what progress had been made so far. Also included is information found from
                    the research and any issues run into throughout the process. The main goal of the paper was to learn how to professionally
                    address an executive audience in a technical writing format.
